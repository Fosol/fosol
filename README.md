## Welcome

Hi, I'm Jeremy Foster, a Software Engineer and Solution/Technical Architect.  I am an active contractor working in Victoria, BC Canada.

The most recent project I'm working on is a news aggregate and curation tool.  The solution ingest audio, video, paper, and internet content and curates it all through transcription, Natural Language Processing, and good old editors.  The architecture is primarily a container based microservice platform with a Kafka backbone.  A whole lot of moving parts working together to improve the subscriber experience.

I've worked on a number of opensource projects in the past few years, and continue to look for opportunities in this area.
